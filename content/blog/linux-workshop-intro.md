Hey all!

So I decided to make a **hands-on workshop series** teaching essential Linux command-line skills... And here is the result.

**[Start the workshop series here](/blog/linux-workshop/)**

This series will take you from terminal newcomer to confident command-line user. Hope your next "Open the terminal" encounter is more enjoyable :P
