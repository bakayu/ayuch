Hola Amigos! I'm Ayush, I go by bakayu and my friends call me Ayu. <br>
Currently a student in the sophomore year, developer, foss lover and a casual F1 fan.

I love reading fiction novels, some of my all time favorites are - Red Rising, Mistborn, Shadow Slave, The Beginning After The End and The Lord of Mysteries. (I want to read more of Sanderson's books when I get the time)

I'll be using this site for blogging, posting about some cool tech stuff and sometimes about my other interests. Stay tuned if you are interested.

PS: I suck at UI. So all you will find here will be plain text and code, hope you don't mind. ^^
