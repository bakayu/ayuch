## Overview

This website (ayuch.dev) is a personal blog and portfolio. Your privacy is important to me, and this policy outlines how I handle any information related to your visit.

## Information Collection

### Analytics

This site does not use any analytics tools or tracking services. I do not collect, store, or process any personal data about visitors.

### Cookies

This site does not use cookies for tracking purposes. The only cookies/local storage used are:

- **Theme preference**: If you toggle between light/dark mode, your preference is stored locally in your browser's localStorage
- **iine likes**: If you use the like buttons on posts, your like is stored by the iine service to prevent duplicate likes

These are strictly functional and do not track you across websites.

### Server Logs

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect technical information such as:

- IP addresses
- Browser type
- Referring pages
- Date and time of visits

Please refer to [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for more information.
